## Improvements & Ideas

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Make input field and other actionable elements disabled when swapping is in process (API call in real world)
- Use Debounced input field to reduce function calls and expensive operations
- Add dark/light mode to improve user experience
- Make it more accessible like user user can use it completely by using their keyboard


### Features to propose
- If we are charging a fee for swapping, then show it to the user to improve transparency
- To improve the security of users while swapping, can implement a device biometric authentication to enhance the security of the platform
- make it more accessible to other currencies other than USD, as well as to increase its adoption and user base
